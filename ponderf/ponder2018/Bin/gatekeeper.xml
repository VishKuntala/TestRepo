 The decrypt method accepts an ATTESSec cookie string in raw (undecrypted) format,
 a validation type, and an optional path to a directory for trace output; and
 returns the validated and decrypted attESSec cookie string.

	<param name="debugDir">(OPTIONAL) full path to the directory on your server where 
 you would like a trace log to be created.</param>
	<param name="tsAheadLimit">(OPTIONAL) an integer representing minutes in the range of 10 to 60, that specifies when the secure CSP cookie is not considered a short term cookie by this application. </param>
	<returns>Returns the decrypted and verified attESSec cookie string or an empty string. 
 
 An empty string is returned in the following cases: 
 1) The date stamp within the cookie string is in the past
 The date stamp is set to be 13 hours from the time of last 
 login, giving the cookie a 13 hour lifespan. 
 The date stamp comparison is done against the application 
 server system time, so if the system time is significantly 
 skewed, this could cause problems with cookie lifetime. 
 2) The cookie string is contaminated. The cookie may have been truncated 
 or tampered with. 
 3) The validationEnv does not match with the cookie The cookie may have 
 been created in CSP webtest, and your system is expecting a CSP 
 production cookie. Or the cookie may have been created for a 
 VendorID, yet your site only wants to allow ATTUIDs. 
 In both of these cases, the empty string is a flag that 
 signals that the user is not authorized to use your application.</returns>
